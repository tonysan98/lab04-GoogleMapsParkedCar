1. To handle permissions and location services we modified the Android manifest to include ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission.
    We implemented getLocation() method which uses fusedLocationProviderClient.lastLocation to asynchronously fetch the user's last known location.
    Then updateMapLocation(userLocation) updates the map's camera to the user's current location. For the car icon we implemented getBitmapDescriptorFromVector(R.drawable.target_icon)
    which converts a vector drawable into a BitmapDescriptor for use as a marker icon. For the functionality we implemented a onclickListener to the button
    which fetched the current location, updated the viewmodel and then added the marker to the user's location.
